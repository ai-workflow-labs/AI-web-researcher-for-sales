🧠 Automated Account Research Workflow (AI + Web)
This workflow automates account research by using AI to search the web and extract structured information — removing the need for manual research typically performed by sales reps during prospecting.
It transforms unstructured inputs (like a domain or company name) into clean, actionable insights by leveraging AI, Google search, and website content extraction.

🚀 What This Workflow Does
The workflow uses an Advanced AI Module with two core capabilities:
1. 🔎 Google Research via SerpAPI
Automatically performs Google searches to gather publicly available information about a company.
2. 🌐 Website Content Extraction
Uses a sub-workflow to visit the company website and retrieve relevant content for analysis.

🧩 Final Output
From just a company name or domain, the workflow returns structured properties:


domain


company LinkedIn URL


cheapest plan


has free trial


has enterprise plan


has API


market (B2B or B2C)



🔧 Fully Customizable with n8n
The real power of this workflow is flexibility:


You can modify the research criteria as needed.


Simply update the AI prompt with the type of information you want to extract.


Specify the expected format in the Structured Output Parser module to ensure clean, consistent results.


This makes the workflow adaptable for any sales, marketing, or competitive research use case.

📌 Summary
This automation replaces manual investigation with a scalable AI-powered research assistant — saving time, improving accuracy, and allowing sales teams to focus on outreach instead of digging through the web.
